<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sinus Bradycardia Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pacemaker</li><li>Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Sinus Bradycardia Devices market includes two primary types: Pacemakers and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs). Pacemakers are devices implanted to regulate slow heart rates by sending electrical signals to the heart, ensuring it beats at an adequate pace. ICDs, while primarily designed to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias by delivering shocks, can also monitor heart rhythm and assist in managing bradycardia conditions. Both devices enhance patient quality of life and reduce the risk of complications associated with abnormal heart rhythms.</p></p>
