<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antifungal Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Azoles</li><li>Echinocandins</li><li>Polyenes</li><li>Allyamines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The antifungal drugs market is categorized into several types, including azoles, echinocandins, polyenes, and allylamines. Azoles, such as fluconazole, inhibit fungal cell membrane synthesis, while echinocandins target the cell wall, making them effective against Candida and Aspergillus species. Polyenes, like amphotericin B, disrupt cell membranes to kill fungi, and are often used for severe infections. Allylamines, such as terbinafine, inhibit a key enzyme in fungal ergosterol synthesis, making them useful for treating dermatophyte infections. Each class plays a crucial role in antifungal therapy.</p></p>
