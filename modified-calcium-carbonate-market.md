<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Modified Calcium Carbonate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heavy Calcium-base Material</li><li>Light Calcium-base Material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The modified calcium carbonate market is divided into two main types: heavy calcium-based materials and light calcium-based materials. Heavy calcium carbonate is typically produced through the dry grinding of limestone and is characterized by its high purity, opacity, and excellent whiteness, making it ideal for use in paints, plastics, and rubber. Light calcium carbonate, on the other hand, is produced by precipitating calcium carbonate from calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, offering finer particle sizes and higher surface area, which enhances its applications in pharmaceuticals, food, and personal care products.</p></p>
