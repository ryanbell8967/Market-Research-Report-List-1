<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Run-flat Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting</li><li>Support Ring System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The run-flat tire market encompasses two primary types: self-supporting tires and support ring systems. Self-supporting tires feature reinforced sidewalls that maintain structural integrity even when deflated, allowing for limited mobility without air pressure. Conversely, support ring systems utilize an inner ring that supports the tire's weight when air is lost, enabling drivers to continue safely for a certain distance. Both types enhance safety and convenience, minimizing the risk of tire-related accidents and the need for immediate replacements.</p></p>
