<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wind Energy Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-Supporting (Free-Standing) Tower</li><li>Guyed Tower</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wind energy equipment market includes various tower types for supporting wind turbines, primarily categorized into self-supporting (free-standing) towers and guyed towers. Self-supporting towers, often built from steel or concrete, are designed for stability without external support, allowing for easy installation in diverse terrains. Guyed towers, on the other hand, utilize cables anchored to the ground for structural support, making them taller and more cost-effective for higher wind capture. Both designs facilitate efficient energy generation while addressing site-specific requirements.</p></p>
