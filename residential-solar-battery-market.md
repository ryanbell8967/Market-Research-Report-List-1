<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Residential Solar Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Independent Type</li><li>Integrated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The residential solar battery market can be categorized into two main types: independent and integrated. Independent type batteries operate separately from solar systems, allowing users to retrofit existing setups to store excess energy. In contrast, integrated type batteries are built directly into solar panel systems, optimizing space and energy management. Both types cater to homeowners seeking energy independence, resilience during outages, and enhanced energy efficiency, but they differ in installation complexity and design compatibility with solar technologies.</p></p>
