<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Ionizer Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fan Base Type</li><li>Fanless Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air ionizer equipment market can be categorized into two main types: fan-based and fanless systems. Fan-based ionizers use internal fans to circulate air, enhancing the distribution of ionized particles throughout the space, which can improve air quality more rapidly. In contrast, fanless ionizers rely on natural convection or passive methods for air circulation, resulting in quieter operation. Both types aim to reduce airborne pollutants, but their mechanisms and efficiency levels differ, catering to varied consumer preferences.</p></p>
